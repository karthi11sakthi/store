            <p>A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of 
                consumer goods in different areas of the store,
                 each area ("department") specializing in a product category.
                 In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle 
                 of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of 
                 service and luxury.
                 Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys),
                in Paris (Le Bon Marché) and in New York (Stewart's).
